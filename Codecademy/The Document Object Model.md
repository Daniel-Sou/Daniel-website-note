# THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
## Review

Congratulations on completing our introduction to the Document Object Model, or DOM, as a structure!

Let's review what you've learned so far:

- The DOM is a structural model of a web page that allows for scripting languages to access that page.
- The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document.
- Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements.
- The DOM also allows access to the regular attributes of an HTML element such as its style, id, etc.

With this understanding, you can begin to leverage the power of scripting languages to create, update, and maintain webpages!
