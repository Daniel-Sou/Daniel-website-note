# JAVASCRIPT AND THE DOM
## Review
In this lesson, you manipulated a webpage structure by leveraging the Document Object Model interface in JavaScript.

Let's review what we learned:

- The ``` document ``` keyword grants access to the root of the DOM in JavaScript
- The DOM Interface allows you to select a specific element with CSS selectors by using the ``` .querySelector() ``` method
- You can also access an element directly by its ID with ``` .getElementById() ```
- The ``` .innerHTML ``` and ``` .style ``` properties allow you to modify an element by changing its contents or style respectively
- You can create, append, and remove elements by using the ``` .createElement() ``` , ``` .appendChild() ``` and  ``` .removeChild() ``` methods respectively
- The ``` .onclick ``` property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event
